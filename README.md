# DSM: The Decentralized Systems Map

## Abstract

This paper reviews the various technologies which make up the
decentralized web movement and classifies them in terms of their
responsibilities within an OSI-style conceptual model called DSM: the
Decentralized Systems Map.


The desired outcome of this paper is six-fold.  (1) To promote
collaboration, cooperation, and mutual-understanding between those
parties creating decentralized web technologies, (2) to clarify the
purpose, statuses, and relationships of decentralized web
technologies, (3) to better inform and educate the general public, (4)
to obtain a more hollistic understanding of which necessary
decentralization components are present and which are missing, (5) to
conduct a meta experiment of producing a decentralized, reproducible
research document and, above all (6) bringing the decentralized web
movement closer to solidarity and to becoming an official w3c working
group.
